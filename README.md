# HACKERRANK FUN TIME

## Explanation
As a way of bettering myself in terms of algorithmic logic, I've been going through HackerRank's Interview Preparation Kit and tackling its different challenges. It's been an interesting mix of frustrating and fun, but it certainly has become more fun the further I've gone in.
